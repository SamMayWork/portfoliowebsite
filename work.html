                            <p>My main responsilbility in this role was helping customers to find the product right for them, processing their orders and working with the till system. If a particular product wasn't in stock it would also be my challenge to find a way of getting a product to a customer whether this be organising a delivery or working with them to find an alternative suitable product.
                            <p>This role also included oppurtunities to go beyond my job role, allowing me to manage stock and oversee deliveries into the business. I also pushed myself and performed addtional duties in this role including basic cash office duties such as cashing up tills at the end of the shift.

                            <p>During my time volunteering I was presented with many challenges which allowed me to further develop skills which I had been using throughout University and work.
                            <p>This role involved running a Code Club event in a local school, teaching pupils between the ages of 9 and 11 the basics of computer programming.
                            <p>The challenge of this role was simplifying difficult to understand concepts to a level which could be understood by primary aged pupils while also trying to inspire them to experiment with code and have fun. 
                            <p>Working with primary pupils trying to inspire them to experiment with code was the most rewarding part of this experience, along with the skills which I developed.
